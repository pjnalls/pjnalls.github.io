          <p className="py-2">
            I'm a frontend developer with UI architecture experience providing
            React, Angular, and some cross-platform development consulting along
            with other technological services â€” having many opportunities for
            frontend-architectural and UI/UX designs and implementations from
            day to day.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2">
            Along with both part-time + full-time consulting, I'm also a
            postgraduate beginning a program for an M.S. in computer science in
            May of 2023.
            <br />
            <br />
            As hobbies, I learn and practice Python, data science, machine learning,
            mathematics, philosophy, yoga (in the traditional sense), and different yet similar languages and
            cultures.
            <br />
            <br />
            Work as a consultant and for personal pet projects feels like high
            forms of both creative and analytical expression, and I strive to be
            completely devoted to and singularly focused on the process of
            designing and developing great DX, CX, UX, and, most importantly, PX
            â€” great people experience above all. ðŸ‘†{" "}
