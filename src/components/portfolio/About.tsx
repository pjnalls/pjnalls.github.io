            I'm a frontend developer and Angular consultant with some career
            development experiences in React and other frontend technologies.
            <br />
            On the side (as a hobby), I learn Python, data science, machine
            learning, pure mathematics and started picking up C- and
            hardware programming for personal maker projects.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-black dark:text-white">
            Along with frontend development, I enjoy using Photoshop and Figma
            for mockups, wireframes, prototypes, and other designs in order to
            communicate with clients about UI/UX.
            <br />
            <br />
            Work as a consultant and for my own UI projects feels like high
            forms of creative expression, and I'm honored to do the work I do
            everyday üôè.
