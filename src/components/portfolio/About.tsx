            As a self-described UX engineer currently working as a UI
            consultant, I&apos;m equally involved in the both UI design and
            development spaces.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-black dark:text-white">
            I have experience in HTML, Sass (SCSS), and ES6+ JavaScript and am
            currently focused on React, Next.js, Angular (mainly), Tailwind CSS, and Astro
            front-end libraries and frameworks.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-black dark:text-white">
            Along with UI coding, I enjoy using Photoshop and Figma for mockups,
            wireframes, prototypes, and other designs in order to communicate
            with clients about UI/UX.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-black dark:text-white">
            Work as a UI consultant and for my own personal projects feel like
            forms of creative expression, and it&apos;s a joy to create UI
            everyday üôè.
