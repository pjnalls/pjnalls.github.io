            I'm a frontend developer providing React and Angular consulting
            along with other technologies for UI designs and implementations.
            <br />
            Along with full-time consulting, I&apos;m also a postgraduate
            beginning a program for an MS in computer science in summer of 2023.

            one small goal after the next". We use MERN, React Native, and

            Work as a consultant and for personal pet projects feels like high
