Spaced Repetition Software (SRS), like Anki, may not be new technology, but it's tremendously underrated at what all it can do for your long-term memory.

Because of SRS, I was able to learn more Japanese in 2 years than I did in 10 years using traditional language-learning methods. ðŸ¤¯

I love how SRS make it so I don't need to review the same flashcards. Every. Single. Day. Due to the spacing of the study intervals, learners can expect to spend significantly less time reviewing cards. Whether 5 or 50 cards a day, it's completely up to the learner at how much they're willing to study each day.

While most apps today are design to keep you using them as much as possible, SRS apps are designed to keep you *away* from them as much as possible by efficiently cutting down on the time that you need to review flashcards.

If you need to quickly memorize things, like words, expression, and sentences in a language, hope you give a try! ðŸ˜Š
