I'm burning the midnight oil tonight rewriting my portfolio website ðŸŒ™
Astro, React, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript are what I'm using to rebuild it.

Unsatisfied with the performance of the former website, I chose Astro as my web framework as it's known for building fast, content-driven websites, and ensures it's much easier to receive 100/100 for all Google Chrome Lighthouse scores including performance (See the incredible results it gives you in the image below) âœ¨
It took a little bit of learning to develop with Astro's frontend architecture Islands, but using React elements in it became much easier after a while once I mastered the basics of using them.

Additionally, Astro provides a highly performant and well documented Markdown blog template available as an option when you first scaffold your project. I have my blog subsite disabled for right now but will certainly enable it once I have enough content to share.

Moreover, when it came time a few moments ago to deploy the first version of my rewrite, other than a few minor configuration issues, the deployment went relatively smooth and the site finished deploying in well under a minute ðŸš€

In conclusion, while Astro may have a bit of learning curve in the beginning, it's well worth the time I invested in learning it and has certainly exceeded my expectations ðŸ’¯
