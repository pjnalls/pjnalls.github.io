According to cosmologists, if we were to put the entire age of the universe on a one-year calendar, everything humans have ever done is on *the last second of December 31st* (Carl Sagan).

Think about that.

I've been thinking about this fact while doing some mindfulness today, and it's truly humbling to me.

In an age where seemingly all corporations, many governments, and most professionals, including myself (I must admit), take AI, especially achieving AGI, so seriously, it helps us sometimes to take a long pause and fathom the immensity of the universe, and how small we are in it.

I'm no expert on this topic, but after giving myself enough time to calculate and think within my limited knowledge of the age and size of the universe, I believe there is definitely intelligence astronomically better than ours that assures me that even when the singularity of AI is reached, it's still "only *one second* in a year" compared to age of the Earth, the Sun, other stars, and space, which may have an underlying intelligence of their own. ðŸ’¡
