I often read advice on building software to become a better software engineer, and I couldn't agree more.

However, starting projects that go beyond tutorials can be difficult, especially when you have no idea what you want to work on next.

That's why I recommend CodeCrafters.

I was introduced to them at work a few years ago and always return to the following GitHub repo when I'm between projects and need some inspiration on what to build next: https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x.

Hopefully, this repo inspires other developers like it did me.
