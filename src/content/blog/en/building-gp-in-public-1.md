🎉 Finally, I'm demoing what I've quietly built for about a week! 🙌

After having terrible npm dependency hell, the Graphluency app is in great shape! ☺️

I've completed initial development for the UI, Expo Router layouts, index and profile routes, login, Redux state management, and some essential composite and atomic feature and UI components.

For this initial phase of development, I wanted to focus on the UI, inspired by my favorite video game. ✨

Furthermore, modern app developers use flat color palettes for simple and clean design, but I decided to try to push the limitations of Expo and React Native, using alpha values in colors and gradients. I'll also use animations in future development phases. 

If you're curious about what technologies I'm using, here are some ingredients I worked with in this phase 🧑‍🍳🤌:<br/>
✅ TypeScript<br/>
✅ React<br/>
✅ React Native<br/>
✅ Tailwind CSS<br/>
✅ Redux<br/>
✅ Expo<br/>
✅ Jest<br/>
✅ Babel<br/>
✅ Nx<br/>
✅ Node.js<br/>
✅ Vis.js

I'm far from releasing the first version of the app, yet so much has been done aesthetically, technically, and architecturally this past week that it feels like a significant milestone. 🥳

Stay tuned for more updates on the Graphluency project! 😊
