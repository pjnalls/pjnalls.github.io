I finished building a side navigation feature today for this website that I'm excited to share ✨


I received inspiration from the documentation web pages for Tailwind CSS by Tailwind Labs.

I looked at the code of their documentation on GitHub and thought, "What if I could somehow put my Markdown blog posts next to a new side navigation menu like theirs?"

And, from there, I went to work refactoring and enhancing this website's navigation and blog web pages.

I'm so glad how it turned out! 🤩
