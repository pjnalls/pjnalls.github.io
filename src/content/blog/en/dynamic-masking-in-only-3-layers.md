It takes only 3 layers in Figma to create the effect above.

Here's how to create it in 10 simple steps:

(1.) Put all what you want to mask in one group.<br/>
(2.) Duplicate the new group and adjust the group's colors.<br/>
(3.) Ensure size and position of both groups are the same.<br/>
(4.) Create a shape with the pen tool or use a primitive.<br/>
(5.) Ensure the first group is the top layer.<br/>
(6.) Ensure the new shape is the next layer below the top one.<br/>
(7.) Ensure the second group is below both of these layers.<br/>
(8.) Select both the top layer and the shape below.<br/>
(9.) Show options for both layers in left panel.<br/>
(10.) Select "Use as mask."

And that's all it takes âœ¨
