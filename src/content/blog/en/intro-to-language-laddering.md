A great reason to learn a 2nd, 3rd, 4th language etc., depending on the languages you want to learn, is you can strengthen one while you learn another. This is called "language laddering". 🪜

This concept is a little complex, so let's use an example.

Let's say your native language is English, and you learned to understand and use Spanish to eventually have no need for English as an aid for studying Spanish. 
Congratulations! 🎉 You now can learn, e.g., Portuguese with Spanish. 
*This* is language laddering. 

Learning Portuguese with Spanish when Spanish is not your native tongue is difficult, no doubt, but this method ensures you *must* know Spanish in order to learn Portuguese, so you'll really be mastering two languages when you're only learning one. 🙂

In other words, you won't "need" to learn Spanish because you already know it, or at least well enough to learn Portuguese. Now, if there is something you don't understand in Portuguese *and* Spanish when learning Portuguese, then and only then you can fallback to an English translation for your Spanish. 🔄

As for me, I plan to ladder 3 of my languages.<br/>
Below are some more ideas of how to ladder languages, which I plan to use:

🌐 Learn Portuguese with my Spanish.<br/>
🌐 Learn Cantonese Chinese with my Mandarin Chinese.<br/>
🌐 Learn Korean with my Japanese.

I'd highly encourage you to Google about "language families" or "what language is most similar to [enter target language]".

Until the next post, Happy learning everyone! ✌️❤️😊
