🎉 [jobdemand.app](https://jobdemand.app) is now live, letting you pick jobs and see their demand from 2023 to 2033!


Yesterday, I spent my Sunday converting the Python console app for Jobdemand into a Vite + React web app, integrating Chart.js for the data visualization section of the page.

The web app took significantly longer to build than I expected, but I managed to get perfect Google Lighthouse scores! 💯

Here was my development process:<br/>
Downloaded data → Converted to CSV → Created a script to convert CSV to JSON → Created components for the datatable → Used Chart.js for a bar graph → Fixed styling bugs → Fixed a11y issues → Ran Lighthouse and fixed the app until all issues were resolved.

🧑‍🍳 Ingredients:<br/>
 • Python<br/>
 • Matplotlib<br/>
 • Pandas<br/>
 • Requests<br/>
 • Node.js<br/>
 • React<br/>
 • Vite<br/>
 • Chart.js<br/>
 • TypeScript<br/>
 • HTML<br/>
 • CSS

I'm glad I could exercise some of my full-stack and data science skills this weekend. I learned so much, and I feel a lot more confident in building things! ✨
