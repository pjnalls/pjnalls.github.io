This morning, I had my first Portuguese lesson in Spanish, and it went great! 😃 The lesson was 99.5% in Portuguese and Spanish, 0.5% for a couple of English words for a false cognate. ✨

I can say for sure that the tutor and I were able to "ladder languages" successfully today with this language pair for the first time and the first try! 👏

It's so interesting that although my goal is to learn Portuguese, using Spanish to learn it and only using 0.5% English during the lesson today has made me *a lot* more confident in my Spanish. 💪

So much so that I assured a Spanish speaker I met today that it's okay to speak at a normal pace. Of course, they were being kind by slowing down the pace of their spoken Spanish for me, but I assured them that it'd be okay if they sped up. Our Spanish conversation became a lot more enjoyable because of that. 😊

I'm looking forward to discovering more benefits of "language laddering"! 🪜

Now, on to the next Portuguese and Spanish lessons! 🙌
