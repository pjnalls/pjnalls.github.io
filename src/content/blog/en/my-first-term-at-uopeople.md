I successfully completed my first term at the [University of the People](https://www.uopeople.edu/). I'm tremendously grateful to have the privilege of studying here.

So far, everyone at the university—the staff, colleagues, professors, and the president—has made a significant impression on me.

Furthermore, the university's mission of making higher education affordable for all, regardless of their country of origin, deeply resonates with me and many others.

It's no wonder a segment on PBS NewsHour was dedicated to the university.

I'm so proud of my university and all that it's accomplishing for the People.

Now, on to my second term, starting next Thursday! ✨
