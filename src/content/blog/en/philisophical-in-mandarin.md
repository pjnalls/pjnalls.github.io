My Mandarin hasn't been so great today, but when my Chinese tutor and I started discussing philosophy, surprisingly, I was able to give an original answer to the chicken-or-egg question. 🐓🥚

"是先有的鸡还是先有的蛋？" asked the tutor as a joke. This is equivalent to being asked, "What came first, the chicken or the egg?"

I answered, "The egg, because while the egg obviously needs the chicken, the chicken also needs the egg, and that which is inside the egg is more similar to how organisms were a very long time ago than the chicken itself." 

☝️This was on the spot without me practicing my answer... 😲

I keep proving to myself every day that "foreign immersion environments at home" (see links to versions of the article below about it) work.

I hope you all give it a try someday! 🙂
