React gives us the gift of JSX. Tailwind CSS, functional styling.
Together, they can create great developer experiences âœ¨

Ah, there's something so satisfying about using Tailwind's CSS utility classes inline within JavaScript XML (JSX) code ðŸ¤“
In my experience, that's not only true with new development, but also with enhancements and maintenance of apps with React/React Native and Tailwind CSS/NativeWind code.

Sure, the long string of inline CSS classes in markup might look like bad practice, but it just makes sense for styles to be right there in the JSX code as JSX itself is the markup and JavaScript of a React component in the same file.
Furthermore, we can abstract away certain component code to other files if needed.

At the end of the day, we need to choose tools which are best suited for particular projects.

I just find that React/React Native and Tailwind CSS/NativeWind fit most of my use cases when building UI's for most apps I build âœ…
