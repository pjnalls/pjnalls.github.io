Today, I discovered a simple technique to get multiple translations simultaneously with Google Translate. üöÄ

While the Google Translate application itself doesn't support simultaneous translations into multiple target languages currently, you can still create a Google Sheets sheet and use the `GOOGLETRANSLATE` function to load as many translations as you want from your source text. ü§Ø

What I'm doing in the blog hero image provided above is the following:<br/>
1Ô∏è‚É£ Input an example sentence in English to be translated by the original Google Translate application.<br/>
2Ô∏è‚É£ Get the Korean translation.<br/>
3Ô∏è‚É£ Copy the Korean translation into the Google Sheets sheet cell for the source text.<br/>
4Ô∏è‚É£ Get the text for multiple translations for each cell in the target languages specified with `GOOGLETRANSLATE` based on the source text.

Why is this useful?

Well, it's always good to check machine translation by translating it back to your mother language and other languages you know, IMHO.

Furthermore, I personally think this could be one technique for me to fast-track my Korean to getting to B1 (intermediate) Korean and then, sooner than later, a monolingual Korean reading comprehension level.

Of course, this isn't limited only to Korean; it's a translation tool for polyglots, and with Google Translate adding many more rare languages to its list of supported languages recently, novel and useful `GOOGLETRANSLATE` API integrations are golden for multilingual purposes.

Now, gonna go learn some Korean lyrics! ‚ô™ ‚ò∫Ô∏èüéß
