"Turn It On And Leave It On" üîå

‚òùÔ∏è This mantra helped me learn more Spanish in 2 months than in 5 years.

The method has two simple rules of thumb:<br/>
1Ô∏è‚É£ Continuously play audio in your target language as long as possible.<br/>
2Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure the subject matter of the audio is something you already know.

I've been following these two rules recently as a beginner in Korean, and I'm learning many common, useful words, expressions, and sentences quickly by watching on repeat, e.g., a 5-hour Python basics course in Korean with Korean subtitles.<br/> 
I work from home, so I've been starting the 5-hour video and putting it on repeat‚Äîonly putting it on pause when I have a call.<br/>
Besides that, just like a lot of people do with TVs, I simply "turn it on and leave it on" as long as I possibly can. üì∫

Furthermore, whenever I notice a pattern of the sounds that I hear in Korean, like what seems to be a word or an expression, I'll type what I hear into Google Translate, where the Korean subtitles help with spelling, and translate it into a language I know. Then, repeat‚Äîmaybe rewinding the video, but definitely keeping it playing as long as possible. ‚è™‚ñ∂Ô∏è

Moreover, I've gone through Python basics many times over the years as a developer, so to watch a video in Korean about the absolute basics of a programming language I know already makes it so *I know a ton about the context of the Korean I hear (since the Korean is about Python basics), so that I only need to focus the target language alone and not understanding anything of what the video is about*. üí°

*This* is allowing me to draw recursive connections from the Korean language to meaning quicker and deeper, as my environment is all Korean all the time.

I don't worry about trying to understand everything, but only focus on picking up a word, expression, the beginning of a sentence, the end of a sentence, etc., at a time. ‚è≥

And what if I lose focus?

That's okay because the video is always on, and I go in and out of focus with the video just like other people do with their native language(s) and TVs.

I've only started learning Korean two weeks ago, and I can almost form sentences when I speak and type in Korean, thanks in large part to this method.

There's more to acquiring a language than what I'm mentioning here, but to "turn it on and leave it on" is a method that makes the process a lot easier, IMHO.
