I just finished tutoring 14 one-hour one-on-one private lessons in a day for the first time, and I surprisingly feel great. Today was fun, and I don't feel tired. Here's why:

I worked as if I were playing.

Yes, work can come with many responsibilities.
Yes, work can come with immense risks.
Yes, work can be too great for us to handle.

But there doesn't need to be a "rigid division between work and play" (Alan Watts).

With play, we can be more effective at our jobs, turning the mundane into dance.
With play, we can become more flexible and handle more responsibilities.
With play, tasks are less mentally taxing and less stressful.

Playful, not out of seriousness but out of sincerity towards everyone around us.

Work as play.
