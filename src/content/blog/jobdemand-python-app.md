Today, I created a Python app that generates charts showing the jobs users pick and their demand from 2023 to 2033.

With a lot of uncertainty in the global job market, I think an app should exist to allow users to pick top jobs they're interested in or could be potentially good at and see whether or not they're in demand in the future, with the public data provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

I'm considering refactoring the project into a Django backend to expose Jobdemand (the name of the app) to a frontend client that I can build later.

I'm glad I had the opportunity to learn a little about how to develop a data analysis solution and hope to integrate machine learning in the future to gain some experience with data science.

After all, jobs for data scientists are forecasted to grow by over 35%, as you can see! 📊👀
