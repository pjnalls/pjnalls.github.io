Recently, I've developed a Python data science project architecture and workflow that works well for me, and I'd like to share how it works.

In the `src/` folder of the directory shown below, there is a Python console app. The architecture is simple and compact, as you can see.

As for the workflow, it can be run with a shell script.

The shell script executes `python -m src.main "path/to/your/data.csv"`.

Then, the Python program does the following sequentially:<br/>
 1Ô∏è‚É£ Preprocesses the CSV file.<br/>
 2Ô∏è‚É£ Utilizes terminal UI that gets user input.<br/>
 3Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluates user input against the dataset.<br/>
 4Ô∏è‚É£ Visualizes data based on the evaluation.<br/>
 5Ô∏è‚É£ Displays a chart based on the visualization.<br/>

Each step in the data analysis process is contained in Python modules rather than all the code for the app being in the main Python file.

Please feel free to use this project as a template or let me know what you think.

P.S., Below is a closer look at the Python architecture:
