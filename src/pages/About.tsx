          🏡 Hi, I'm Preston. <br />
          Welcome to my portfolio website!
          <br />
          <br />
          👷 I have 7+ years of frontend software development experience and am
          currently only accepting contracts for React Native and React
          development and will continue to do so as I transition at this time as
          a doctoral candidate applicant.
          <br />
          <br />
          🦄 I consider myself a quite the unicorn as I'm interested to great
          depths in all aspect of STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art,
          and mathematics). Currently, I'm actively seeking to improve my
          frontend mobile and web software development expertise with React
          Native, understanding of quantum computers and neural networks with
          online courses, and Traditional Mandarin with language learning
          platforms such as Preply.
          <br />
          <br />
          💼 Please feel free to look around while you're here.
          <br />
          Thank you for visting!
