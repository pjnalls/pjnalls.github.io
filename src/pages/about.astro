      <p>
        I'm a software engineer and tutor with 8+ years of web and mobile
        development experience. I primarily write code in Python, TypeScript,
        and Go, and recently started learning Java, developing full-stack apps
        and data science pipelines. I also train people and provide AI annotated
        data to train it how to code in Python, Typescript, and Go üß†.
        <br /><br />
        I'm a Master of Science in Information Technology postgraduate at the University
        of the People (MS IT @ UoPeople) üìö.
        <br /><br />
        Once I graduate, I'd like to be a Master of Science in Computer Science postgraduate
        with a Specialization in Machine Learning at Georgia Institute of Technology
        (MS CS, ML @ Georgia Tech) ‚ú®.
        <br /><br />
        When I'm not coding or studying, I spend most of my free time in introspection
        üßò, cooking üç≥, and listening to a ton of music üéß.
        <br /><br />
        Ultimately, I'm pursuing MS degrees in both IT and CS because 1Ô∏è‚É£ UoPeople
        and Georgia Tech have the most affordable and highly accredited graduate
        degree programs (as far as I know), and 2Ô∏è‚É£ I believe this is <i>the</i> time
        to upskill for the AI revolution ü§ñ.
