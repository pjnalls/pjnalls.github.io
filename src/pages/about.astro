      <p>
        I'm a Master of Science in Information Technology postgraduate at the
        University of the People (MS in IT @ UoPeople) üìö.
        <br /><br />
        Once I graduate, I'd like to be a Master of Science in Computer Science postgraduate
        with a Specialization in Machine Learning at Georgia Institute of Technology
        (MS in CS, ML @ Georgia Tech) ‚ú®.
        <br /><br />
        I'm also a software engineer with 8+ years of frontend development experience
        and a tutor. I primarily write code in React Native, NativeWind, and TypeScript,
        building and teaching people and AI how to build cross-platform Expo apps
        for iOS, Android, and the Web. I also develop machine learning models with
        PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Python üß†.
        <br /><br />
        When I'm not studying or coding, I spend most of my free time in introspection
        üßò, cooking üç≥, and listening to a ton of video game music üëæ.
        <br /><br />
        Ultimately, I'm pursuing MS degrees in both IT and CS because 1Ô∏è‚É£ UoPeople
        and Georgia Tech have the most affordable graduate degree programs (as far
        as I know), and 2Ô∏è‚É£ I believe this is *the* time to upskill for the AI revolution
        ü§ñ.
