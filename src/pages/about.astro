        I'm an MSIT postgraduate (Master of Science in Information Technology)
        at UoPeople (the University of the People), deeply curious about the
        challenges of technological and psychological integration within
        society.
        <br />As a software engineer and tutor, I primarily code in React
        Native, NativeWind, and TypeScript, building and teaching people and AI
        how to build cross-platform Expo apps for iOS, Android, and the Web.
        <br /><br />
        Beyond coding, I spend most of my free time on introspection and scientific
        observation of the internal and external worlds within the human experience.
        I usually strive to reconcile the fragmented collective and individual human
        psyche with the ever-accelerating integration of technological advancements.
        I share my discoveries on my blog, which is available at <a
          href="https://pjnalls.github.io/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">pjnalls.github.io</a
        >.
        <br /><br />
        Ultimately, I believe in a future where technology fosters genuine connections
        and does not incite prejudice, discrimination, or conflict, and am driven
        by a desire to contribute to a world where technology and human connection
        coexist harmoniously, fostering understanding and unity across borders.
