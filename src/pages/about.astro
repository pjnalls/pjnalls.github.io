        My journey is one of connection â€“ connecting people through technology,
        through language, and a shared vision of a more compassionate world. My
        passion, encapsulated in the #ONELOVE ethos, drives me to build
        technology that puts people first.
        <br /><br />
        As a React Native Engineer, I strive to create "human-centered UI," ensuring
        technology serves to empower, not overwhelm. My belief in "user-owned data"
        stems from a deep respect for individual autonomy and the ethical use of
        information. I believe in a future where technology fosters genuine connections
        and does not incite prejudice, discrimination, or conflict.
        <br /><br />
        Beyond coding, I'm dedicated to bridging cultural gaps. As a tutor on Preply,
        I share my love of language, guiding students toward fluency. My JLPT N2
        certification and extensive Mandarin coursework reflect my commitment to
        multilingualism and cross-cultural understanding. Speaking English, Japanese,
        and Mandarin (at a B1 level) along with some understanding of Spanish allows
        me to connect with diverse communities and contribute to a more interconnected
        world.
        <br /><b></b>
        Ultimately, I'm driven by a desire to contribute to a world where technology
        and human connection coexist harmoniously, fostering understanding and unity
        across borders.<br /><br />
        I'm currently seeking remote job and online
        academic opportunities. Please send a direct message on <a
          href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pjnalls/">LinkedIn</a

        if you're a recruiter and would like to discuss further.
