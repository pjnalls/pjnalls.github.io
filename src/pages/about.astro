    As I mentioned on the homepage, my name is Preston and I have 7+ years of
    frontend web and mobile application development experience and am currently
    building cross-platform Expo apps in React Native and TypeScript for iOS,
    Android, and the Web. <br />Some other JavaScript libraries I use for my
    projects are Tailwind CSS and NativeWind for inline styling.<br /><br
    />Along with frontend development expertise, I can use Figma
    to create most of my designs and assets for my projects.<br /><br />I'm
    currently seeking new React Native job opportunities in the Nashville
    Metropolitan Area either hybrid or onsite or opportunities which are remote
    as well.<br /><br />Please direct message on LinkedIn if you're a recruiter
    and would like to discuss further.
