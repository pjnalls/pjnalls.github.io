## Why start a blog?

<br/>

I've been wanting to integrate a simple Markdown blog into my personal portfolio to take notes of ideas and inspirations
which I have concerning subjects such as technology, mathematics, philosophy, and art — to name a few. 
<br/>
Inspirations are "elusive" as [Elizabeth Gilbert described during a TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86x-u-tz0MA) posted in 2009, and I'd like to capture them in a concrete manner whenever possible.

<br />

I don't plan on writing for any particular end-goal or order, but I'll most likely write from a variety of angles and be interdisciplinary if needed. I may choose either a depth-first or breadth-first approach to my note-taking as needed.
