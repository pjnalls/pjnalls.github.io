> "When I'd play [at the age of 12], **I'd play to my weaknesses**. ...I would work on things I was weak at. Left hand, pull-up jump shot, post-game. So I have a strategy... Fast forward to when I'm 17, my game is completely well-rounded and the player I saw at 13 is still doing the same [expletive] at 17... now you got a problem" (Kobe Bryant)

<br />

## "Play[ing] to my weaknesses" as a frontend engineer as a specialist and a software engineer as a generalist

<br />

JavaScript and other technologies utilized for frontend design and development have always been a part of the technological stacks I've leveraged, even as a web-developer consultant.

<br />

However, I've been recently reminded of a 2019 interview where Kobe Bryant described one of the unbeatable strategies he developed at an early age of basketball before he went pro.

<br />

I have _many_ "pull-up jump shot" scenarios as a frontend-developer consultant I could devote practice to during my early mornings before regular work.

<br />

The next sections will show some technical skills which could use some work with _#1_ being my weakest skill.

<br />
<br />

## #3 UI components that are _equally_ 1) visually appealing, 2) efficient, and 3) extensible

<br />

ðŸ‘† By this section header, I mean the _balance_ of focuses between visuals, efficiency, and extensibility of UI components I create or enhance. It's _so_ easy to fixate on only one of these areas when creating components â€” having the foresight of a frontend architect for potential maintainability issues as a UI project scales.

<br />

**Solution**:

<br />

One, visual appeal of components can often be subjective (especially on teams without a designer), so integrating tools like [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) into an existing UI project or integrating a design system into an internal Figma library for an organization might help to better communicate and bring what is visually appealing for UI components to a clear consensus.

<br />

And two, for both a) efficient and b) extensible components, I think writing automated, isolated component tests should be able to "describe" the efficiency and extensibility of your component by what operations your suite of tests performed on their instantiations.

<br />
<br />

## #2 To C or not to C?

<br />

I'm still debating on whether to devote some time to learning C or a language like Java for more data-oriented programming.

<br />

You can check out GeeksforGeeks' article [Difference between Java and C language](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-java-and-c-language/) and decide which you think would be better for you to learn as I did.

<br />

I will give my reasons below:

<br />

Java seems like the _de facto_ programming language for getting into most big tech companies â€” for running the gauntlet of technical interviews and within the corporations themselves (with the exception being _maybe_ Microsoft). Not to mention, it's used for native Android development.

<br />

However, I've heard the claim made that Java is verbose (or "wordy")... Not to say C is terse, but Java has more keywords (32 [in C] versus 50 [in Java]).

<br />

With that said, I want to learn C because it's so _finite_... in a good way, and it's another _de facto_ (and not to mention _fast_!) programming language used ubiquitously in systems programming. Also, the lowest it's ever been on TIOBE Index is **"#2 in Nov 2022"** (["The C Programming Language"](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/c/))

<br />

It's been **#1** many times on the index as well and is a language that has been around since the 70s.

<br />

**Solution**:

<br />

There's a [classic textbook for C programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language) by authors Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie which seems to be _the_ book for learning C which might be worth me getting on a Kindle.

<br />

Vim and the C-compiler [should already be available with an Xcode installation](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) and [should come with Visual Studio for PC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/walkthrough-compile-a-c-program-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-170).

## #1 Learning Python and the incentives to do so

<br />

What prompted me to start writing this article was a notification I received this morning for learning Python as a part of a master's program at a certain university and there are some _nice_ incentives for doing so...

<br />

In February 2003, Python was #13 on the TIOBE Index. Now, it sits **#1 _today_** (12/4/2022, when I'm initially writing this article). [You can check out the massive growth it's had since 2018](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/python/).

<br />

Python is the most significant and fastest-growing language in use and shows no signs of slowing.

<br />

I haven't even gotten into the _technical_ reasons why we should learn Python...

<br />

**Solution**:

<br />

Take some time to learn Python, and research as many incentives as you can out there for you to learn it.

2023 will be the year to play to all these ðŸ‘† weaknesses as a developer to stay current and, more importantly, humble.
