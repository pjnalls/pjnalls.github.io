<br />

There is a great piece from a piano collection called ["Find Your Way"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeaqHWN_qhc) that really captures the overall tone I had navigating through the world of writing software and the ubiquitousness of computer programs ‚Äî gradually finding both specific and general roles within the tech field which I truely needed to strive and do well.

<br />

## As a computer-science undergraduate

<br />

I did well in school and graduated in 3 years, but I didn't listen...

<br />

When I showed a project I did for class to someone who was like a mentor in the same computer-science program, they said (paraphrasing), "You should do UI development".
However, I insisted that I should pursue fullstack development to start.
There was even another individual farther along in his career than I that also warned me about the lofty, fullstack pursuit as well (‚ö†Ô∏è I have nothing against fullstack development, but it's just not for me).

<br />

## As an intern

<br />

I also did well in both my internships. They were both fullstack-related and I learned _many_ things, but I was not prepared for the next paths ahead...

<br />

## As a web-developer consultant

<br />

Out of the internships, I went straight into a fullstack, cloud-developer role where I found out after joining that I'd be a team lead...
Needless to say, I was _way_ over my head.

<br />

After much angst, I thought it'd be wise to stepdown and gain experience _first_ as a consultant.

<br />

And yet again, I was not prepared for the world of consulting... Fullstack? Now, consulting? I was even more green than before at this point ‚Äî trying to push two boulders uphill, only to have them both roll back down and hurting myself in the process.

<br />

## The 3-year of period of "intermediate angst" and its ongoing effects

<br />

The "Find Your Way" piece I mentioned at the beginning of this article is really for the 3 years of "intermediate angst" I endured to eventually make the full transition into frontend development and gain the clarity I needed to navigate my career a little better.

<br />

Not to say that "I've arrived" ‚Äî not at all, but (again) I was able to start gaining the clarity I needed to know what job best suits me going forward.

<br />

I'm _still_ finding my way and always will, and after those 3 years, I was finally able to strive at least.

<br />

## As a frontend developer as a specialist and a software engineer as a generalist

<br />

> "A great specialist is also a good generalist" (Unknown Source)

<br />

Again, I still haven't really arrived anywhere writing software, but I do feel that I have somehow (through many factors for which I am grateful) passed a significant threshold where "find[ing] your way" is, at least, _natural_.

<br />

I now am in a position to provide both React and Angular consulting to my clients and build React Native applications for my personal pet projects.

<br />

At this point and going forward, I'm focusing on "stay[ing] hungry [and] stay[ing] foolish" (Steve Jobs). üëà I'm sure there's a particular context and purpose for the original quote, but for me, in the context of navigating tech careers, I want to ensure that I'm both, 1), receptive to new work experiences and opportunities and, 2), to keep my beliefs and presuppositions aside, because I'm ultimately striving and...
