## Why start a blog?

<br/>

I've wanted, for quite some time, to integrate a simple Markdown blog into my portfolio website to take notes of ideas, reflections and inspirations
which I have concerning STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) as well as documenting my personal growth in these disciplines — sharing what I've learned.
<br/>
For ideas and inspirations, I'm reminded of how "elusive" they are as [Elizabeth Gilbert described during a TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86x-u-tz0MA) posted in 2009, and I'd like to capture these phenomena concretely as possible whenever I'm able.

<br/>

I don't plan on writing for any particular end-goal or order, but I'll let these writings mutually arise, write from a variety of angles and be interdisciplinary as needed. 
<br/> I may switch between a depth-first or breadth-first approach to the flow of writing as needed in order to pen-down discoveries as I scribe.
